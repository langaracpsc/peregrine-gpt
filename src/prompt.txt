Personal Identification Number
Students are required to enter their nine-digit Langara Identification Number and their Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the registration system. The student’s first and last initials and birth date in year, month, and day (FL-YYYYMMDD) order has been set as the default PIN. If a preferred first name is on file, the student’s first initial of their preferred name is used for the default PIN. If no birth date is on file, students must contact Registrar & Enrolment Services. Students are advised to change their PIN when they access the registration system for the first time. The same PIN is used for all registrations unless students change their PIN on Langara's login page or at Registrar & Enrolment Services. If you have forgotten your Langara ID or PIN, please contact Registrar & Enrolment Services at 604.323.5241.

Important: Keep your Langara College ID and PIN strictly confidential.

How Your Registration Time is Assigned:
New Students
Registration times for new arts and science students are determined by the date of application to the College. Registration times for new career and limited enrolment program students are determined by the date and time assigned to their program.

Returning Students
Registration times for arts and science students are determined using a combination of the number of credits completed and their Langara College cumulative grade point average. Returning career program students register by program and program term.

This is the basic info a student will need to start registering for courses and exams.

Just say "Okay" if you received it.
